# Drunken Sailor

What shall we do with the drunken sailor?  
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?  
What shall we do with the drunken sailor  
early in the morning?

Hooray and up she rises.  
Hooray and up she rises.  
Hooray and up she rises  
early in the morning

Put him in the longboat til he's sober...

Pull out the plug and wet him all over...

Put him in the scuppers with a hose-pipe on him...

Heave him by the leg in a running bowline...

Shave his belly with a rusty razor...
